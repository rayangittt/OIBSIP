🌟 My Internship Projects @ Oasis Infobyte
Hi there! 👋
I’m Mohd Raiyyan Ali, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and working as an Intern at Oasis Infobyte.
During this internship, I got the opportunity to dive deep into Machine Learning and work on some really exciting real-world problems.

This repository contains 3 projects that I built from scratch — from cleaning raw data to training models that actually make predictions! 🚀

📌 Projects I Worked On
1️⃣ Car Price Prediction 🚗
Goal: Predict the selling price of a used car based on features like year, present price, fuel type, seller type, transmission, etc.
What I did:

Cleaned & preprocessed the dataset 🧹

Explored patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊

Tried multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Chose the one with the best accuracy ✅

2️⃣ Spam Email Detection 📩
Goal: Detect whether an email is spam or ham using NLP.
What I did:

Cleaned text data (stopword removal, stemming, tokenization)

Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trained a Naive Bayes classifier

Got a model that’s quick & efficient at spotting spam!

3️⃣ Sales Prediction 📈
Goal: Predict product sales based on ad spend across TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
What I did:

Explored relationships between ad spend & sales

Built a Linear Regression model to make predictions

Measured performance with R² and MSE

🛠 Tech & Tools Used
Languages: Python 🐍

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn, NLTK
