🌟 My Internship Projects @ Oasis Infobyte
Hi there! 👋
I’m Mohd Raiyyan Ali, currently pursuing B.Tech in Computer Science and working as an Intern at Oasis Infobyte.
During this internship, I got the opportunity to dive deep into Machine Learning and work on some really exciting real-world problems.

This repository contains 3 projects that I built from scratch — from cleaning raw data to training models that actually make predictions! 🚀

📌 Projects I Worked On
1️⃣ Car Price Prediction 🚗
Goal: Predict the selling price of a used car based on features like year, present price, fuel type, seller type, transmission, etc.
What I did:

Cleaned & preprocessed the dataset 🧹

Explored patterns using Matplotlib & Seaborn 📊

Tried multiple ML models (Linear Regression, Random Forest)

Chose the one with the best accuracy ✅

2️⃣ Spam Email Detection 📩
Goal: Detect whether an email is spam or ham using NLP.
What I did:

Cleaned text data (stopword removal, stemming, tokenization)

Converted text into numerical features using TF-IDF

Trained a Naive Bayes classifier

Got a model that’s quick & efficient at spotting spam!

 
 3. Iris Flower Classification
The classic beginner’s dataset — but still a great one to practice!
Here, I classified iris flowers into three species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using sepal and petal measurements.

Visualized relationships with scatter plots and pair plots

Trained Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, and KNN models

Checked accuracy and confusion matrix for performance

Tech: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Platform: Jupyter Notebook
